Credit Risk Classification Analysis Report

Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning to determine creditworthiness of borrowers. The dataset provided lending activity to develop a model for creditworthiness for this company to make an informed decision for lending.   
 
Factors in determining lending from CSV:

• Size of the loan
• Interest rate on the loan
• Borrower’s income
• Debt to income ratio
• Borrower’s number of accounts 
• Derogatory marks on borrower’s credit
• Total debt

Analysis:

The lending data CSV dataset was large in having 77,526 data points.  The CSV dataset was first reviewed in a DataFrame.  The data was split into testing and training sets and the “loan status” column was first dropped. The dataset was split by using sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split.  The training set was utilized to build a logistic regression model by using sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression.  The reason for making this training model was to find out whether a loan will be of low or high risk to the borrower. Next the testing data samples drew 19,384 test samples that fit the model with X-test.  A confusion_matrix was made of the of the test samples producing the following matrix:

[[18679    80]
 [   67   558]]

The numbers in the confusion matrix breakdown are as follows 18679 (True Positive), 80 (False Negative “Type II error”), 67 (False Positive “Type I error”) and 558 (True Negative).  There is a possibility the model will have False Negatives and False Positives from this matrix.
Lastly a classification report was made, and more details are shown below in the results section.

• The model in predicting low-risk loans was 100% precise.
• The model was only 87% precise in predicting high-risk loans.
• The total average precision was 93% (by averaging 100% and 87%)
• For recall the model had 100% in predicting low-risk loans.
• The recall model was 89% in predicting high-risk loans.
• The total average recall precision was 95% (by averaging 100% and 89%).
• The total accuracy was 94% (0.94)

Summary:

The logistic regression model is best for predicting healthy loans (0) with good precision and recall.  The model may make false positive predictions on predicting high-risk loans (1).  The model suggests using this model for predicting healthy loans (1) 100% precise and 100% recall and be cautious when it’s used as a model for predicting high-risk loans (0) 87% precise and 89% recall.  The prediction may yield a false negative or false positive when used as model for predicting high-risk loans.
